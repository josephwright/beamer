2004-09-23 Till Tantau <tantau@users.sourceforge.net>

	Version 2.99

	Release notes:
	- This is a pretest version. Version 3.00 will be the next "real"
	  release. The present version should not be distributed as
	  bundles or suchlike.
	- You need pgf 0.63 and xcolor 2.00 for this version.
	- Quite a lot has changed. However, old presentations should
	  compile just fine, except if really wicked things have been
	  done. If a reasonably normal old presentation no longer
	  compiles, please drop me a line.
	- Some small color and spacing changes in the old themes may
	  occur. 

	
	Themes:
	- Completely new theme management.
	- Lot's of new variations of themes.
	- Font/element/layout/color themes are orthogonal and can be
	  freely combined. 
	- Old themes obsolete, but supported for compatibility.
	- Original default theme is now in
	  "beamerthemecompatibility.sty". New default is more minimalistic.

	+ Presentation themes:
	- There are now 24 ready-to-use presentation themes. 
	- Manuel Carro has send me a theme that I slightly adapted and
	  added as the Madrid theme.

	+ Layout and element Themes:
	- There are 9 different layouts themes, including three new ones
	  that were not available in the previous version.
	- There are 4 different element themes (which dictate things like
	  how items are typeset).

	+ Color themes:
	- There are 10 color themes, including a yellow-on-blue theme.
	- The seahorse and rose theme allow you to change the colors of
	  headlines and footlines easily to much less "aggressive"
	  versions.  
	- You can now dictate the color of every minute detail of a
	  presentation individually, (including math!).

	+ Font themes:
	- 6 font themes. Change the fonts of titles to, say, small caps
	  just by using the smallcaps theme; no need to meddle with
	  templates. 
	- Just like colors, you can individually change all fonts in
	  minute detail without touching any templates.

	
	Documentation:
	- Split documentation into multiple files.
	- Reorganized and reworked large parts of the documention.
	- Added a small tutorial to help new users.
	- Extracted all "guidelines" and "recommendations" and put them in
	  a "guidelines" section. Also added lots of guidelines on fonts.
	- Added an index (though it's pretty poor, still).

	
	Solutions:
	- Added a solutions directory.
	  It contains ready-to-use solutions for common problems (like
	  a template for a conference talk).
	- Help appreciated (see the documentation).

	
	Added:
	- Added frame environment (finally!).
	- Added the dot notation to overlay specifications. If a dot is
	  used instead of a plus, the beamerpauses counter is not
	  incremented. 
	- Added xmpmulti.sty. Very useful for including Multi Metapost
	  graphics. 
	- Added some functionality to \onslide to get it more in sync with

	  frames.

	  style). Only exceptions are < and >.
	- Added a note on how to use msc.sty with beamer.
	- TOCs in sidebar will now do line breaking (finally!).
	- Powerful object-oriented new font management.
	- Powerful object-oriented new color management.
	- \tableofcontents now has more options for showing/not showing
	  entries.
	- Same is true for the toc in sidebars.
	- Added \keywords command (like \subject).
	- Added a patch to make beamer work together with musixtex. \pause
	  will be redeclared inside music environments.
	- Added \insert's for inserting the start and end pages of the
	  current frame, subsection, section, part, presentation, appendix.

	Changed:
	- Reordered directories.
	- beamerboxesrounded now works differently. color schemes no
	  longer needed.

	  instead and load new style beamerarticle.

	- Slight changes to vertical spacing.
	- slidestop is now called "t" and slidescentered is called "c".
	- \beamersetleftmargin and \beamersetrightmargin obsolete. Use
	  \setbeamersize instead.

	  color and vertical spacing changes may occur.

	  resulted from an allowframebreaks.

	  that.  
	- Added <> option to \newcommand and \newenvironment to make the

	  faster cvs checkout/checkin.
	- Removed \invisibleon command (was superfluous anyway).
	- Removed \mixinon command (was not very useful and clashes with
	  new \pause command; use \opaqueness instead).
	- Removed \newoverlaycommand and \renewoverlaycommand. Can be
	  better implemented using \newcommand<>.
	- Removed \article, \presentation, and \common commands (still
	  quietly tolerated). Should be replaced by \mode<article>,
