    There is no largest prime number.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item<1-| alert@1> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    \item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
    \item<3-> Then $q+1$ is not divisible by any of them.
    \item<1-> But $q + 1$ is greater than $1$, thus divisible by some prime
      number not in the first $p$ numbers.\qedhere

\part{Getting Started}

This part helps you getting started. It starts with an explanation of how to install the class. Hopefully, this will be very simple, with a bit of luck the whole class is already correctly installed! You will also find an explanation of special things you should consider when using certain other packages.

Next, a short tutorial is given that explains most of the features that you'll need in a typical presentation. Following the tutorial you will find a ``possible workflow'' for creating a presentation. Following this workflow may help you avoid problems later on.

This part includes a guidelines sections. Following these guidelines can help you create good presentations (no guarantees, though). This guideline section is kept as general as possible; most of what is said in that section applies to presentations in general, independent of whether they have been created using \beamer\ or not.

At the end of this part you will find a summary of the solutions templates that come with \beamer. You can use solutions templates to kick-start the creation of your presentation.

\part{Building a Presentation}

This part contains an explanation of all the commands that are used to create presentations. It starts with a section treating the commands and environments used to create \emph{frames}, the basic building blocks of presentations. Next, the creation of overlays is explained.

The following three sections concern commands and methods of \emph{structuring} a presentation. In order, the \emph{static global} structure, the \emph{interactive global} structure, and the \emph{local} structure are treated.

Two further sections treat graphics and animations. Much of the material in these sections applies to other packages as well, not just to \beamer.

\include{beamerug-overlays}
\include{beamerug-globalstructure}
\include{beamerug-interaction}
\include{beamerug-localstructure}
\include{beamerug-graphics}
\include{beamerug-animations}



\part{Changing the Way Things Look}

\beamer\ offers ways to change the appearance of a presentation at all levels of detail. On the top level, \emph{themes} can be used to globally change the appearance conveniently. On the bottom level, \emph{templates} allow you to specify the appearance of every minute detail individually.

Two important aspects of the ``appearance'' of a presentation are treated in extra sections: colors and fonts. Here, too, color and font themes can be used to globally change the colors or fonts used in a presentation, while you can still change the color or font of, say, block titles independently of everything else.

\part{Creating Supporting Material}

The objective of the \beamer\ class is to simplify the creation of presentations using a projector. However, a presentation rarely exists in isolation. Material that accompanies a presentation includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Presentations should normally be accompanied by \emph{handouts}, written text that the audience can read during and/or after your presentation is given.
\item
  You might wish to create notes for yourself that, ideally, are shown to you on your computer screen while the audience sees the presentation.
\item
  You might wish to create a printout of your talk, either for yourself or for checking for errors.
\item
  You might wish to create a transparencies version of your talk as a fall-back.
\end{itemize}

This part dicusses how \beamer\ helps you with the creation of the above.

\include{beamerug-twoscreens}



\part{Howtos}

This part contains explanations-of-how-to-do-things (commonly known as \emph{howtos}). These explanations are not really part of the ``\beamer\ core.'' Rather, they explain how to use \beamer\ to achieve a certain effect or how get something special done.

The first howto is about tricky uncovering situations.

The second howto explains how you can import (parts or) presentations created using some other \LaTeX-presentation class, like \prosper.
